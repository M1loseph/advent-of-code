## 🎄 Advent of Code solutions 🎄

Examples are implemented in a language I wanted to use in a particular year. I guess there will me mostly Rust and C++, occasionally Kotlin.

My progress in Advent of Code looks as follows:

| Year | Languages  | Stars ⭐ |
| ---- | ---------- | ------- |
| 2024 | Rust       | 50      |
| 2023 | Rust / C++ | 16      |

### TODO:

- 2024 / day 16 - create a visualization for path finding and create a true A*
- 2024 / day 22 - parallelize the bruteforce solution
