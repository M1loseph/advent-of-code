#### Performance optiomization

First version of puzzle 2 solution reallocated laboratory map matrix (that was 130 * 130 * 4 bytes â‰ˆ 66kB) in each iteration. Let's say, 90% of fields are not an obstacle. That means, it had to allocate around 1GB od data during the program life!

| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Allocating new matrix every time I flip PATH tile to the OBSTACLE time                  | 14603ms                             |
| Flipping one tile and manually reverting guard position and direction in each iteration | 11432ms                             |

So yeah, there is some performance improvement, but I expected more.
